Look up at the sky
My mouth is open wide, lick and taste
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying?
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy
I am who I am, who I am well, who am I?
Requesting some enlightenment
Could I have been anyone other than me?
Sing and dance, I'll play for you tonight
The thrill of it all
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
But I'll work it out then I
